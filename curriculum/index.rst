Parts of Regular Expression
=====================================

Regular expressions (regex) are sequences of characters that define a search pattern. They are used to match strings within other strings, extract information, and perform text manipulation. A regex engine interprets these patterns and applies them to text data.

Following are some key components of regular expressions:

1. **Literals**: These are the exact text characters or digits you want to match. For example, `a` or `5`.

2. **Metacharacters**: Symbols with special meanings that help build your regex. Examples include `.` (matches any single character), `^` (matches the start of a string), and `$` (matches the end of a string).

3. **Character Classes**: Denoted by square brackets `[]`, these match any one of the characters inside them. For example, `[abc]` matches any single a, b, or c.

4. **Quantifiers**: Specify how many instances of a character or group are required for a match. For instance, `*` (0 or more), `+` (1 or more), `?` (0 or 1), and `{n}` (exactly n times).
